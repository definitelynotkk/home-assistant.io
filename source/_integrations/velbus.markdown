The `velbus` integration supports the Velbus USB, Velbus serial and a TCP/IP gateway.

There is currently support for the following device types within Home Assistant:

- Binary Sensor
- Climate
- Sensor
- Switch
- Cover

## Configuration

There are 2 options in configuring the velbus integration:

- Via the Home Assistant user interface where it will let you enter the port string to connect to the Velbus bus.
- Via the Home Assistant `configuration.yaml` file.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry for a USB or serial interface
velbus:
  port: 'PORT_STRING'
```

## Port Sstring

The port string used in the user interface or the configuration file can have 2 formats:

- For a serial device: /dev/ttyUSB00
- For a tcp/ip device: 127.0.0.1:3678

{% configuration %}
port:

{% endconfiguration %}
