The `saj` sensor will poll a [SAJ](https://www.saj-electric.com/) solar inverter and present the values as sensors in Home Assistant.

This sensor uses the web interface and to use it, you have to be able to connect to the solar inverter from your favorite web browser.

## Configuration

To enable this sensor, add the following lines to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
sensor:
  - platform: saj
    host: IP_ADDRESS_OF_DEVICE
```

{% configuration %}
